# My Machine Learning Journey with PyTorch & Scikit-Learn

**Status:** In Progress (Actively working through Chapter 5)

This repository documents my dedicated journey to transition into a data science role by building a comprehensive, foundational understanding of machine learning. I am systematically working through Sebastian Raschka's "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn," completing a hands-on project for each chapter to solidify my knowledge.

## My Process

For each chapter, my methodology is:
1.  **Study:** Thoroughly read and digest the core concepts.
2.  **Apply:** Complete a 10-15 hour hands-on project using the chapter's techniques on a real-world dataset.
3.  **Document:** Write a detailed project-specific `README.md` explaining the problem, methodology, and results.
4.  **Reflect:** Author a personal `reflection.md` on the key learnings and challenges.

This "learning in public" approach is my way of tracking growth, ensuring accountability, and building a portfolio that demonstrates both theoretical knowledge and practical skill.
